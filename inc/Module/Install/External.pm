=head1 NAME

Module::Install::External - Specify dependencies on external non-Perl things

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Module::Install::External> provides command that allow you to
declaratively specify a dependency on a program or system that is not
Perl.

The commands it provides are similar to those in L<Module::Install::Can>,
except that they implement an explicit dependency, in addition to just
working out if the particular thing is available.

=head1 COMMANDS

=head2 requires_xs

  requires_xs;

The C<requires_xs> command explicitly specifies that a C compiler and the
perl header files are required in order to build (at F<make>-time) the
distribution (specifically XS files).

It does not take any params, and aborts the F<Makefile.PL> execution in a
way that an automated installation or testing system will interpret as a
C<NA> ("not applicable to this platform") result.

This may be changed to an alternative abort result at a later time.

Returns true as a convenience.

=head2 requires_external_cc

  requires_external_cc;

The C<requires_external_cc> command explicitly specifies that a C compiler
is required in order to build (at F<make>-time) the distribution.

It does not take any params, and aborts the F<Makefile.PL> execution
in a way that an automated installation or testing system will interpret
as a C<NA> ("not applicable to this platform") result.

This may be be changed to an alternative abort result at a later time.

Returns true as a convenience.

=head2 requires_external_bin

  requires_external_bin 'cvs';

The C<requires_external_bin> command takes the name of a system command
or program, similar to the C<can_run> command, except that
C<requires_external_bin> checks in a way that is a declarative explicit
dependency.

The takes a single param of the command/program name, and aborts the
C<Makefile.PL> execution in a way that an automated installation or
testing system will interpret as a C<NA> ("not applicable to this
platform") result.

Returns true as a convenience.

=head1 TO DO

Work out how to save the external dependency metadata, in agreement with
the larger Perl community.

Implement the agreed external dependency metadata solution.
