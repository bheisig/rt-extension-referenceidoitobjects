=head1 NAME

Module::Install::Deprecated - Warnings and help for deprecated commands

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of the nicest features of L<Module::Install> is that as it improves,
there is no need to take into account user compatibility, because users do
not need to install L<Module::Install> itself.

As a result, the L<Module::Install> API changes at a faster rate than usual,
and this results in deprecated commands.

C<Module::Install::Deprecated> provides implementations of the deprecated
commands, so that when an author is upgrading their L<Module::Install> and
they are using a deprecated command they will be told that the command has
been deprecated, and what the author should use instead.

This extension should NEVER end up bundled into the distribution tarball.

=head1 COMMANDS

=head2 c_files

The C<c_files> command has been changed to C<cc_files> to reduce confusion
and keep all compiler commands within a consistent C<ff_foo> naming scheme.

=head2 inc_paths

The C<inc_paths> command has been changed to C<cc_inc_paths> due to
confusion between Perl and C.

=head2 lib_paths

The C<lib_paths> command has been changed to C<cc_lib_paths> due to confusion
between Perl and C.

=head2 lib_links

The C<lib_links> command has been changed to C<cc_lib_links> due to confusion
between Perl and C.

=head2 optimize_flags

The C<optimize_flags> command has been changed to C<cc_optimize_flags> for
consistency reasons.
